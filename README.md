# misleading_news_detector_colab

An AI-powered tool that automatically summarizes meeting transcripts and extracts key action items. Built with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and designed for easy use in research, teams, or personal productivity.

Meetings often run long and contain large amounts of unstructured text. This project streamlines the process by:

Summarizing transcripts into concise notes.

Highlighting action items (tasks, deadlines, responsibilities).

Making it easier for teams to review discussions and decisions quickly.
