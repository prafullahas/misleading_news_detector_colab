# misleading_news_detector_colab

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that detects whether a news article is misleading or reliable using machine learning models. Implemented in Google Colab with free resources, making it reproducible and lightweight for solo projects.

Tech Stack

Python (Google Colab)

NLP Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn

Deep Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional for advanced models like LSTM or BERT)

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Features

Detects misleading vs. reliable news in text form.

Easy to run in Google Colab (no setup hassle).

Extendable with advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT).

Can be adapted for different languages with available datasets.


Future Improvements

Deploy as a FastAPI/Flask app for real-time detection.

Extend to multi-class classification (satire, propaganda, bias, etc.).

Improve explainability using SHAP/LIME.
